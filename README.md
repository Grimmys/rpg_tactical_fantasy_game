## How to help development

You can submit any request you want, or report any bug you encounter, by sending an e-mail to
grimmys.programming@gmail.com or by opening an issue.

Alternatively, you can join the newly created community discord: https://discord.gg/CwFdXNs9Wt.

Feel free to come up with ideas whether it is about coding practices or game mechanics, this project is far from being
perfect!

Here are some suggestions of contributions:

* Check the [opened issues](https://github.com/Grimmys/rpg_tactical_fantasy_game/issues), there are bugs that could be
  fixed or enhancement waiting for implementation.
* A lot of TODOs can be found everywhere on the project, some of them could be easy to fix even by a beginner and others
  are more challenging.
* Help with balancing would be greatly appreciated... I'm not good in this kind of games even if I love them. All values
  could be found in the XML files wrapped in the data folder.
* Contributions for sound effects or new soundtracks would be really appreciated.

__Version__ : 1.0.4

## How to start the game

If you are using 64-bit Windows you can head over to
the [releases page](https://github.com/grimmys/rpg_tactical_fantasy_game/releases) to get a prebuilt executable.

If you would rather run directly from the source \(or want to develop the game\), make sure to
have [Python](https://python.org) installed and run `python -m pip install -r requirements` in the repository folder.

Then you can run `python main.py` or "./main.py" (only for Python 3) in linux operation system to start the game.
