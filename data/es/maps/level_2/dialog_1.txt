The village is safe

Only a few seconds after you placed the remains back on the altar you hear some weird noises...
All the undead in the crypt are crumbling into dust.
You assume it's the same for those who are outside.
Thanks to your intervention, the villagers have been saved and the peace should be back in Nervie.
You are now on your way to the town, thinking of the reward promised by the innkeeper.
