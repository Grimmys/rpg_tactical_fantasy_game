Hello adventurers! The situation is critical, some thugs have stolen ogre bones that were buried in the crypt.
Since then, the village is constantly being raided by the undead...
Fortunately, I managed to recover the bones from the thugs.
You must take them back to their place in the crypt. The necropolis is far to the west of here.
Good luck, adventurers. All the inhabitants of Nervie are behind you.
