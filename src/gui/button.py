    This class is representing any kind of button that could be seen on an interface.
    A button is receptive to user clicks and returns an id corresponding to a method,
    it may have specific arguments too.
    Mouse motion is also handled: the button appearance can change according to current focus.

    Keyword arguments:
    callback -- the reference to the function that should be call after a click
    size -- the size of the button following the format "(width, height)"
    position -- the position of the element on the screen
    sprite -- the pygame Surface corresponding to the sprite of the element
    sprite_hover -- the pygame Surface corresponding to the sprite of the element
    when it has the focus
    margin -- a tuple containing the margins of the box,
    should be in the form "(top_margin, right_margin, bottom_margin, left_margin)"
    linked_object -- the game entity linked to the button if there is one
